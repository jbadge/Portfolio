              I am a technology nerd who has been passionate about tech my
              entire life. I graduated with a degree in physics, but my love for
              coding in college led me to shift my career path. I am dedicated
              to <span className="nowrap">self-improvement</span> and continuous
              learning. When I'm not in front of my computer, I enjoy working
              out and playing board games.

              Looking for a team where I can continue to develop my abilities.
              I've developed my frontend skills{' '}
              <span className="nowrap">(HTML/CSS,</span> React.js, TypeScript)
              over the past couple of years. Prior to learning full-stack, my
              experience was in STEM projects, mostly using Python and C++. My
              favorite language is the one Iâ€™ve used most recently.
